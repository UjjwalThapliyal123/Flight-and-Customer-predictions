# Flight-and-Customer-predictions


This project dives into predicting Flight Prices and Customer Satisfaction using powerful machine learning models. For flight price prediction, we apply regression methods like: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. For classifying customer satisfaction, we use models such as: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. The goal is to deliver accurate predictions through smart feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and robust model evaluation. and the user friendly Streamlit App and a mlflow page .
